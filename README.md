# Visitor Design Pattern

Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new behaviors to existing class hierarchy without altering any existing code.

## What is a design pattern

A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source.
Rather, it is a description for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
